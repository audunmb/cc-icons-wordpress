# Wordpress shortcode for Creative Commons-link with icons 

This wordpress plugin adds a shortcode for showing that images (or other content) is used with a Creative Commons-license.
It's useful if you use images with such licenses often on your webpage. 

It's add the following shortcodes [CC-BY], [CC-BY-SA], [CC-BY-ND], [CC-BY-NC], [CC-BY-NC-ND] and [CC-BY-NC-SA]. 

Each shortcode will add a link to the appriopate license and icons to represent each license element. 

The icons are meant to be used with image captions, with the copyright statement. For instance like this:

> Photo by <a href="link to image file">(photographer)</a>, [CC-BY-SA] via Wikimedia Commons

To add aria-labels, link title in your language and link to the license in your language, translate the plugin.
